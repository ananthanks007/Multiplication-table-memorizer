# Multiplication-table-memorizer

Multiplication-table-memorizer is a simple python program to memorize the multiplication table. Every student needs this simple to use python program which gives you random questions from your desired parameters and forces you to answer questions qucikly thus improving your memory. As a student myself, it is important to remebers the multiplication table upto 20. And this tool will help your remember it

#How to use?

We now that multiplication table consists of two numbers

a x b = c

The program asks you to enter 4 parameters.
the first and second parameters are for 'a' in the above equation, and the third and fourth parameters are for 'b' in the equation.

Let me show you through an Example.

If you want to remember the tables of 1 to 20, then

1st parameter = 1 (Here there is no need for zero because anything times zero is zero!)         (parameter of a)

2nd parameter = 20                                                                              (parameter of a)

3rd parameter = 1                                                                               (parameter of b)

4th parameter = 10                                                                              (parameter of b)


Now by doing the above steps, the value of 'a' range from 1 - 20; and the value of 'b' range from 1-10

Now the program will develop random numbers from these parameters(here, a=[1,20], b=[1,10])
for example, 

16x4 = ?
19x6 = ?

No you have to give the values fast and it will check if your answers are right. If your answers are right, you will get a congratulatory message and if your answer is wrong then it will display the correct answer.

If you practice the table with the help of this program 10 minutes daily, it will surely improve your memorization skills and you will get faster in multiplication and which in turn you will get faster in division and so on....
